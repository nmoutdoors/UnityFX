You are working in **UnityFX.Patterns**, the portable pattern library for SPFx solutions.

This repo contains **documentation only** — no implementation code. It is designed to be referenced by other projects (like UnityFX or customer apps) to provide consistent patterns for:
- Installers (list provisioning, content types, etc.)
- Data services (PnPjs, caching, logging)
- UI shells (fullscreen layouts, navigation)
- Dashboards (card grids, filters)
- Forms (modal editors, validation)
- UI components (Fluent UI patterns)

## How to Use This Repo

1. **`unityfx-manifest.json`** is the index of all patterns.
   - Each pattern has: `id`, `name`, `category`, `file`, `description`
   - Use this to find relevant patterns for any task

2. **`patterns/`** contains the pattern definitions organized by category:
   - `core/` — foundational principles and feature module structure
   - `installers/` — SharePoint provisioning patterns
   - `data/` — data access, services, logging, config
   - `ui-shell/` — fullscreen layouts, app shells
   - `ui/` — Fluent UI usage patterns
   - `ui-components/` — reusable component patterns
   - `dashboards/` — dashboard layouts and filtering
   - `forms/` — modal editors, form handling
   - `experimental/` — work-in-progress patterns

3. **`docs/`** contains supporting documentation:
   - `UnityFX-Standing-Orders.md` — rules for all UnityFX projects
   - `PatternLibrary.md` — how to use and contribute to patterns
   - Other architectural and naming docs

## When Editing This Repo

- **Do not add implementation code** — this is a pattern library only
- **Keep patterns focused** — one concept per pattern file
- **Update the manifest** when adding/removing patterns
- **Use consistent naming**: `<Category>.<PatternName>.md`

## When Referencing This Repo From Other Projects

Other projects should:
1. Document the path to this repo in their `.augment-guidelines`
2. Reference patterns by reading files via shell commands
3. Follow the patterns when implementing features
